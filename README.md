Calculate the peak decibels at a given point for Beethoven's 9th Symphony
(This is just a thought experiment and isn't very accurate.)

"When you keep in mind the fact that soundwaves are a form of air pressure, 576,000 players can play the piece in half a second which would be loud enough to kill anyone in the immediate vicinity" - Rae

apparently not, at least when everyone's outside (which is assumed in this demonstration), it's about 125dB dead in the center

unfortunately you would need a LOT of hearing protection to not be affected by this
~37dB is likely the best you'll get, and that leaves it at 88dB, which is still above hearing loss threshold
